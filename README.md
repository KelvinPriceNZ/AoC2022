# Advent of Code Dec 2022

[Advent of Code site](https://adventofcode.com/)

One folder per day/problem  01-25

each folder has 2 Python scripts, 1 for each part of that day's problem and the `input.txt` for that day downloaded from AoC
scripts are named `day${day}-${part}.py`

the base folder has a script `results.bash`, run it from the base folder to see accumulated results

for each day, cd to that day's folder and run the Python script(s) to get the answer for that day and problem part
in a day's folder, run `../fetch-input` to retrieve that day's input file to `./input.txt`, to do so, you will need to store your AoC session cookie in `~/.aoc.session`
